    <h1>Helicopter</h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="definition">
        A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors. This
        allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally.
        These
        attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms

            Although most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, the configuration of a single main rotor
            accompanied by
            a vertical anti-torque tail rotor (i.e. unicopter, not to be confused with the single-blade monocopter) has
            become
            the most common helicopter configuration. However, twin-main rotor helicopters (bicopters), in either tandem
            or
            transverse rotors configurations, are sometimes in use due to their greater payload capacity than the
            monorotor
            design, and coaxial-rotor, tiltrotor and compound helicopters are also all flying today. Quadrotor
            helicopters
            (quadcopters) were pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and along with other types of multicopters, have
            been
            developed mainly for specialized applications such as drones.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The English word helicopter is adapted from the French word hélicoptère, coined by Gustave Ponton d'Amécourt in
        1861, which originates from the Greek helix (ἕλιξ) "helix, spiral, whirl, convolution"[3] and pteron (πτερόν)
        "wing".[4][5] For various reasons, the word is often erroneously, from an etymological point of view, analysed
        by English speakers into heli- and copter, leading to words like helipad and quadcopter.[6][7] English language
        nicknames for "helicopter" include "chopper", "copter", "heli", and "whirlybird". In the United States military,
        the common slang is "helo" pronounced with a long "e".

    <h2>Design characteristics</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by one or more horizontally-spinning
        rotors.[8] By contrast the autogyro (or gyroplane) and gyrodyne have a free-spinning rotor for all or part of
        the flight envelope, relying on a separate thrust system to propel the craft forwards, so that the airflow sets
        the rotor spinning to provide lift. The compound helicopter also has a separate thrust system, but continues to
        supply power to the rotor throughout normal flight.

    <h3 id="rotorsystem">Rotor system</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The rotor system, or more simply rotor, is the rotating part of a helicopter that generates lift. A rotor system
        may be mounted horizontally, as main rotors are, providing lift vertically, or it may be mounted vertically,
        such as a tail rotor, to provide horizontal thrust to counteract torque from the main rotors. The rotor consists
        of a mast, hub and rotor blades.

        The mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upwards from the transmission. At the top of the mast is the
        attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the
        rotor blades are attached and move relative to the hub. There are three basic types: hingeless, fully
        articulated, and teetering; although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these.
    </p>
    <h3>Anti-torque</h3>
    <p>Most helicopters have a single main rotor, but torque created by its aerodynamic drag must be countered by an
        opposed torque. The design that Igor Sikorsky settled on for his VS-300 was a smaller tail rotor. The tail rotor
        pushes or pulls against the tail to counter the torque effect, and this has become the most common configuration
        for helicopter design, usually at the end of a tail boom.

        <span>Some helicopters use other anti-torque controls instead of the tail rotor, such as the ducted fan (called
            Fenestron or FANTAIL) and NOTAR. NOTAR provides anti-torque similar to the way a wing develops lift through
            the
            use of the Coandă effect on the tail boom.[9]</span>

        The use of two or more horizontal rotors turning in opposite directions is another configuration used to
        counteract the effects of torque on the aircraft without relying on an anti-torque tail rotor. This allows the
        power normally required to be diverted for the tail rotor to be applied fully to the main rotors, increasing the
        aircraft's power efficiency and lifting capacity.
